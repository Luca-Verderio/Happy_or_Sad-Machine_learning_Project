# Image Classification: Happy-or-Sad
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to classify happiness and sadness from emoji-like faces displaying these emotions.  

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense
- Dense

## Data
